                    <li>**Anti-inflammatory Effects**: Research into the soothing and calming properties of propolis and other bee-derived ingredients on irritated skin.</li>
                    <li>**Antimicrobial Activity**: Investigations into the natural antiseptic qualities of our formulations, particularly for products like deodorants.</li>

                </ul>
